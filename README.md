## Overview
For this project, we had to create a task board management application. We had to fix bugs on the provided starter code and also add our coded solutions to ensure the applications functions fully.
We were given user stories as a guideline to ensure specific functionalities. 
The application has 5 main features which are to add a task, update a task, delete a task, toggle a sidebar and toggle between light and dark mode. All these features were built with the help of the provided user stories. We also had to ensure that there is persistence of data through local storage.


## Reflections
I learnt that functions help organise code better and are great for maintaining the code.
I learnt that the use of importing and exporting of functions is important in better organising code.
I learnt that debugging can be challenging and that it is a crucial part of a software developer's role.
I learnt that data can be stored locally to ensure data persistence between sessions. 

## Challenges Faced
It was tricky to understand and follow someone else's thought processes in their code and therefore it became tricky to implement my own solutions.
